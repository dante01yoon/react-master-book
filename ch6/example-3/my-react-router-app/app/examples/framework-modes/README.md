# Framework Mode Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating React Router's different framework modes.

## Examples Included

1. **Client-Side Routing** - Traditional client-side routing with React Router
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Server rendering with hydration
3. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Pre-rendered routes for static deployment
4. **Hybrid Approaches** - Combining different rendering strategies

Each example demonstrates how React Router adapts to different rendering approaches
and explains when each mode is most appropriate.
