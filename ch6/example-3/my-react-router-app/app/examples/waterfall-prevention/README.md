# Waterfall Prevention Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating techniques to prevent data loading waterfalls in React Router.

## Examples Included

1. **Parallel Data Loading** - Loading data in parallel instead of sequences
2. **Deferred Data Loading** - Using `defer` to avoid blocking rendering
3. **Prefetching** - Proactively loading data before navigation
4. **Optimistic UI** - Updating the UI before data is fully loaded

Each example demonstrates techniques to improve application performance by preventing
data loading waterfalls that can delay rendering and hurt user experience.
