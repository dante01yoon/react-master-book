# Comparing RSBuild, Create React App, and webpack

This document provides a detailed comparison between RSBuild, Create React App (CRA), and webpack to help you understand the key differences and advantages of each approach.

## Build Performance

### Build Time Comparison

| Tool | Initial Build | Incremental Build | Dev Server Start |
|------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| RSBuild | < 1 second | ~100ms | < 1 second |
| Create React App | ~10-15 seconds | ~1-2 seconds | ~5 seconds |
| webpack | ~20-30 seconds | ~3-5 seconds | ~10 seconds |

### Memory Usage

| Tool | Memory Consumption | CPU Usage |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| RSBuild | Low (200-400MB) | Efficient, multi-threaded |
| Create React App | Medium (500-800MB) | Moderate, single-threaded |
| webpack | High (800MB-1.5GB) | High, single-threaded |

## Developer Experience

### Configuration Complexity

| Tool | Initial Setup | Customization | Learning Curve |
|------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| RSBuild | Zero-config | Simple, modular APIs | Low |
| Create React App | Zero-config | Requires ejection or custom solutions (react-app-rewired, craco) | Medium |
| webpack | Complex configuration | Highly customizable but verbose | High |

### Hot Module Replacement

| Tool | Speed | State Preservation | Setup Complexity |
|------|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| RSBuild | Very fast (<100ms) | Excellent | Built-in |
| Create React App | Moderate (~1s) | Good | Built-in |
| webpack | Slower (~2-3s) | Variable | Requires configuration |

## Feature Comparison

### TypeScript Support

| Tool | Integration | Type Checking | Compilation Speed |
|------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| RSBuild | First-class | Fast, built-in | Very fast (Rust-powered) |
| Create React App | Via template | Moderate | Moderate (tsc) |
| webpack | Via loaders | Requires setup | Slow (ts-loader) or moderate (babel-loader + tsc) |

### Code Splitting

| Tool | Automatic Splitting | Dynamic Imports | Configuration Required |
|------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| RSBuild | Yes | Built-in | Minimal |
| Create React App | Basic | Supported | None |
| webpack | Manual | Supported | Complex |

### Bundle Optimization

| Tool | Tree Shaking | Minification | Modern Output |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| RSBuild | Advanced | High performance | ES modules and legacy |
| Create React App | Basic | Standard | ES5 target |
| webpack | Configurable | Configurable | Requires configuration |

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

| Tool | Core Engine | Language | Extensibility |
|------|------------|----------|--------------|
| RSBuild | Rspack (Rust) | Rust core, JS APIs | Plugin system |
| Create React App | webpack | JavaScript | Limited without ejection |
| webpack | webpack | JavaScript | Loaders and plugins |

### Plugin Ecosystem

| Tool | Ecosystem Size | Plugin Creation | First-party Plugins |
|------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| RSBuild | Growing | Straightforward | Modern essentials |
| Create React App | Limited | N/A (requires ejection) | Fixed set |
| webpack | Extensive | Complex | Numerous |

## Production Readiness

### Output Size

| Tool | Bundle Size | Code Splitting | Dynamic Imports |
|------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| RSBuild | Optimized, smaller | Intelligent | Efficient |
| Create React App | Standard | Basic | Supported |
| webpack | Depends on config | Manual | Configurable |

### Browser Support

| Tool | Modern Browsers | Legacy Support | Polyfills |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| RSBuild | Optimized for modern | Configurable | On-demand |
| Create React App | Good coverage | Fixed targets | Included |
| webpack | Configurable | Configurable | Manual |

## Practical Considerations

### Migration Difficulty

| From â†’ To | RSBuild | CRA | webpack |
|-----------|---------|-----|---------|
| RSBuild | - | Easy | Medium |
| CRA | Easy | - | Hard |
| webpack | Medium | Hard | - |

### Project Types

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| RSBuild | Modern React apps, performance-critical applications, TypeScript projects |
| Create React App | Quick prototypes, learning React, standard applications |
| webpack | Complex custom build requirements, non-React applications, legacy support |

## Conclusion

### When to Choose Each Tool

**Choose RSBuild when:**
- Build performance is critical
- You're using TypeScript
- You want zero-config with flexibility
- You need fast HMR for development
- Your app has many components and packages

**Choose Create React App when:**
- You're learning React
- You want a standardized, well-documented approach
- You don't need customization
- You want to leverage a mature ecosystem

**Choose webpack when:**
- You need complete control over the build process
- You have complex custom requirements
- You need specific loaders or plugins not available elsewhere
- You're building something other than a React application

### The Future of Build Tools

As web applications grow in complexity, build performance becomes increasingly important. RSBuild represents a new generation of build tools that leverage systems programming languages like Rust to improve performance significantly while maintaining developer experience. This trend is likely to continue, with more build tools adopting Rust or similar languages for performance-critical operations.
